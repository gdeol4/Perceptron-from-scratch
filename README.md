# Perceptron-from-scratch

This project was made to show (and for me to learn) how to write a simple perceptron learning algorithm to classify an arbitrary data set  - since my current reserach involved cheminformatics I chose a drug data set. The files included are images in the Jupyter notebook, the data in csv format, and the notebook itself. 

## Packages
The following python packages need to be installed to run the code:

1. NumPy - https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html
2. pandas - https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html
3. scikit-learn - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html
